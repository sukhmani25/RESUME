# Assignment_01 Reflection

## Can I explain what my code does?
Yes, I can explain my code. This HTML file make a personal resume website.
It show my details like contact info, skills, education, and interests.
I used basic HTML tags like header, section, main, and footer. I also added
an image and one SVG with alt text for accessibility.

## What was my coding process?
First, I made the project folder and basic HTML structure. Then I added
each section one by one. I used Git to save my work regulary with commits.
I checked my code to make sure everything is working properly.

## What challenges did I have?
At start, I was confused about semantic HTML and accessibility things like
alt text . I fixed this by checking examples and reading the
instructions again.

## What would I do differently now?
Next time, I will plan the sections before coding and think about
accessibility from starting. This will make the work more easy.
